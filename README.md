# belly-button-challenge

For the GWU bootcamp we dug into JavaScript this module. We explored the Plotly library and conducted several exercises to dig into JavaScript and visualizations. I thought it was a very interesting module as I have worked with Plotly Python before and used Dash to create a similar Dashboard setup. Using JavaScript was a first for me and I found it very interesting and am looking forward to using JavaScript more ofthen in the future.

Research background

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

You can find the Dashboard I made for this project here:
